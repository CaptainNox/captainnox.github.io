## Whoami?

I am Nox, a 20 year old cybersecurity student from Belgium. I have been passionned by webhacking and malware for quite a while. I started with learning webhacking, and now I am making the transition to reverse engineering and malware analysis.

## What got me into this?

I have always been interested in the mechanics of malware. In the summer of 2023 is when I started putting effort in trying to understand them. Which lead to the development of [Hypnos](https://github.com/CaptainNox/Hypnos). A small userland evasion project, which got me *hooked* ;).
