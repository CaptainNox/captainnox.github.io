## Introduction!

*Behind The Binary* is my blog where I will post my reverse engineering and malware analysis research.

## The purpose

The purpose of *Behind The Binary* is to document my progress in these fields, and to help others who are joining me in my journey. I guess I will see you in one of my future posts!

Kind regards, Nox.
